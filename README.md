# Hi, I'm Sander Mirck 👋

I'm an IT enthusiast with a strong interest in DevOps, homelabbing, self-hosting, and just troubleshooting issues. I'm currently focused on building my skills in software development and system administration with the goal of becoming a DevOps engineer. I also really like linux, it's my favorite operating system (Kernel, but you know what i mean by operation system).


- 🔭 I’m currently working on automating and expanding my home lab. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Ansible and git.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to homelabbing and infrastructure as code.


### My tools and Technologies
- Languages: Python, Go and Rust.
- Platforms: Docker and Kubernetes
- Cloud: My home network 😏
- Tools: Slowly working towards using git and github.
